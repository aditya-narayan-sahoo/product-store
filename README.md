## Getting Started üèÅ

Follow these steps to get your own instance of Product Store up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (Neon DB used here)
- npm, bun or yarn

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aditya-narayan-sahoo/product-store.git
    cd product-store
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example`
    - Fill in the necessary values:

      ```
      PORT=3000

      PGUSER=your_db_user
      PGPASSWORD=your_db_password
      PGHOST=your_db_host
      PGDATABASE=product_store_db
      ARCJET_KEY=your_arcjet_key
      ARCJET_ENV=development
      ```

      **Note:** Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and the database exists.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the API (Backend):**

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the backend server, typically on port 3000 (or the port you specified in your `.env` file).

2.  **Start the Frontend:**

    ```
    cd frontend
    npm install # install frontend dependencies
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the React development server for the frontend. The frontend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar address).

3.  **Whole Application:**
    If you want to run the whole app at once then just do the following:
    ```
    npm run build && npm run start
    ```

Refer to the documentation of your chosen platform for specific deployment instructions. Make sure to configure the environment variables correctly in your deployment environment.
